Create and display 3 different views of the recordset (see sample here):
Output 1 – sorted by gender (females before males) then by last name ascending.
Output 2 – sorted by birth date, ascending.
Output 3 – sorted by last name, descending.
Ensure that fields are displayed in the following order: last name, first name, gender, date of birth, favorite color.
Display dates in the format MM/DD/YYYY, with no padding when M or D only have one digit.
